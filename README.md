DQ data cloud access

This repo gathers for my personal use data that are already online and publicly reachable, but for one reason or other, are not conveniently accessed.  Alternatively, the data here are such that I have saved them in a specialised format (RDS, say) for faster loading.  

The original online data might not be conveniently accessible for different reasons.  The data originator might have neglected to provide an API for online R access, or the online versions might only be available in a format not useful for cloud manipulation.  All data copyright belong to their originators, not to me. I have not changed or tried to improve any of the numbers in these datafiles, but only saved them in a more useful format or given them a URL for convenient online access (i.e., not just for downloading).  All data here are available elsewhere, just that a little more work might have to go into getting those data, than here.
