DQ data cloud access

This repo gathers for my personal use data that are already online and publicly reachable, but for one reason or other, are not conveniently accessed.  Or, I might save the data in a specialised format (RDS, say) for faster loading. 

The original online data might not be conveniently accessibl for a range of reasons. It could be because the data originator neglected to provide an API for online R access, or that the online versions are only available in a format not useful for cloud manipulation.  All data copyright belong to their originators, not to me. I have not changed or tried to improve any of the numbers in these datafiles, but only saved them in a more useful format or given them a URL for convenient online access (i.e., not just for downloading).
