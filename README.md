DQ data cloud access

This repo gathers for my personal use data that are already online and publicly reachable, but for one reason or other, are not conveniently accessed. 

This last might be because the data originator neglected to provide an API for online R access, or that the online versions are only available in a format not useful for cloud manipulation.  All data copyright belong to their originators, not to me. I have not changed or tried to improve any of the numbers in these datafiles, but only saved them in a more useful format or given them a URL for convenient online access (i.e., not just downloading).
